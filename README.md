# odin-recipes

This is the first project I am tackling in [The Odin Project's Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations). It is (for now) a very basic recipe cataloging website meant to test what I have learned of HTML so far. 

## Road-map
In the future I plan to revisit and add more advanced styling with CSS.
